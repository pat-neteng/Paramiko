Paramiko is a Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol. 
Just like the pxssh subclass of Pexpect, 
Paramiko simplifies the SSHv2 interaction between the host and the remote device. 
Unlike pxssh, Paramiko focuses only on SSHv2 with no Telnet support.
It also provides both client and server operations.

Paramiko is the low-level SSH client behind the high-level automation framework Ansible for its network modules.
